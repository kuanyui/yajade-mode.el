* yajade-mode

=yajade-mode= is yet another major-mode for [[http://jadelang.net/][Jade]] / [[http://jadelang.net/][Pug]] template language.

** Compare to =pug-mode= & =jade-mode=
- Better (or less-mistakes) syntax-highlights than =pug-mode= and =jade-mode=. (see screenshot)
- Compatible with [[https://github.com/purcell/mmm-mode][mmm-mode]]
- No inline JS / CSS highlight (please use =mmm-mode= to achive this)

** Known Bugs
- Emacs's syntax engine cannot deal with single-line string, it's uncustomizable and always match paired quotes across lines (doc: [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Syntax-Class-Table.html#Syntax-Class-Table][1]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Syntax-Flags.html#Syntax-Flags][2]]), so quote character in plain-text (e.g. =span() foo's bar=) will still be wrongly interpretered.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It's impossible to fix currently unless GNU Emacs improves its syntax APIs, or write a real parser to replace the rules for string quotes in syntax-class-table.
#+END_QUOTE

- [[http://jadelang.net/reference/code/][Buffered code]] is wrongly highlighted. I've ever tried to solve this with =yajade--font-lock-attr= function, but font-lock act more bizarre than JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
- Highlight for [[http://jadelang.net/reference/tags/][nested tags]] (e.g. =a: img=) is not handled. Same reason as =buffered code=.
- Multi-line string block is not handled.
- I found =yajade--font-lock-remove-highlights-in-plain= will still broke =mmm-mode= (see [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Search_002dbased-Fontification.html][Search-based Fontification in font-lock official doc]]) so I finally comment it out... (alas)
